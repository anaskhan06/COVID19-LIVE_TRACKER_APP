    COVID-19 typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever and cough.
In some patients - particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions
 - these symptoms can develop into pneumonia, with chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.
After a week, it can lead to shortness of breath, with about 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment.
